## Setup Anaconda to Manage Cloned ArcGIS Pro Python Environments

 **1. Run ArcGIS Pro as Administrator.**

**2. Create a new Python virtual environment in ArcGIS Pro as depicted below by cloning the default Python environment arcgispro-py3 (while you can use any unique name for your cloned environment, the steps below use deep learning).**

**3. Install Anaconda. Then, check for the new cloned ArcGIS Pro Python virtual environment in Anaconda. Uh oh...it's not listed:**

**4. Locate Anaconda's .condarc file (C:\Users\XXXXXXXX\.condarc). Original file content:**

**5. Make the necessary edits to the .condarc file:**

**6. There, now the ArcGIS Pro Python environment that we cloned for the purposes of deep learning is available to us for configuration in Anacondaâ€™s familiar GUI & Command Line interfaces:**

**7. Finally, now that our Python environment for deep learning in ArcGIS Pro is properly configured, we just need to make sure that we set it as the active Python environment for our project in ArcGIS Pro:**
