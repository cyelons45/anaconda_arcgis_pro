## Setup Anaconda to Manage Cloned ArcGIS Pro Python Virtual Environments

 **1. Run ArcGIS Pro as Administrator.**

**2. Create a new Python virtual environment in ArcGIS Pro as depicted below by cloning the default Python environment arcgispro-py3 (while you can use any unique name for your cloned environment, the steps below use "arcgispro-py3-deeplearning").**

**3. Install Anaconda. Then, check for the new cloned ArcGIS Pro Python virtual environment in Anaconda. Uh oh...it's not listed:**

**4. Locate Anaconda's .condarc file (C:\Users\XXXXXXXX\ .condarc). The original file will look something like this:**

**5. Now, edit the .condarc file as depicted below:**

**6. There, now our cloned ArcGIS Pro Python environment is available for configuration in Anacondaâ€™s familiar GUI & Command Line interfaces:**

**7. Finally, now that the cloned ArcGIS Pro Python virtual environment is properly configured, we just need to make sure to set it as ArcGIS Pro's active Python virtual environment like so:**
